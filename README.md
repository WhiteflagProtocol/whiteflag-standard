# The Whiteflag Protocol
We believe we can prevent loss of lives in disaster and conflict areas around the globe, that may occur by lack of information.

The Whiteflag Protocol provides a reliable means for both combatant and neutral parties in conflict zones to digitally communicate pre-defined signs and signals using blockchain technology. The protocol can also be used to communicate information about natural and man-made disasters, thus creating shared situational awareness beyond conflicts.

The signs and signals can be securely communicated using a decentralised protocol, the Whiteflag Protocol, that describes a trusted messaging network for disaster & conflict areas.

More background information can be found in the [Whiteflag wiki](https://github.com/WhiteflagProtocol/whiteflag-standard/wiki).

## Protocol Specification
The [whiteflag-standard repository](https://github.com/WhiteflagProtocol/whiteflag-standard) contains the officially released versions of the Whiteflag Protocol specification, a.k.a. the Whiteflag Standard, including a number of supporting artefacts.

The purpose of this project repository is to describe, define and publish the communications protocol and associated message format for policy makers, developers and other specialists to be able to adopt and implement the Whiteflag Protocol.

## Repository Structure
The main source document of the Whiteflag Protocol specification is `WhiteflagSpecification.md`. This document is currently under review before it will be uploaded as a markdown text file to this repository.

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax; see [RFC 7763](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7763) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for more information on this media type. Using Markdown allows the standard to be easily maintained and to be published in other formats, such as html or pdf.

Along with the standard, a number of artefacts with parts of the specification described in a structured language ([JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159)) will be published. This allows for fast and interoperable implementation. The following artefacts are currenlty planned to be made available:

* `WhiteflagMessageSchema.json`: JSON schema of the Whiteflag message structure and field syntax

## Versioning
[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is used for the Whiteflag specification.

## Configuration Control
It is foreseen that this standard requires updates in the near future as a result of validation and to ensure compatibility with emerging blockchain practices, paradigms and standards. However, an appropriate configuration process for this this specification as an open standard is still under consideration. For the time being, issues may be raised and discussed in this project repository, and will be openly considered by the original authors.
